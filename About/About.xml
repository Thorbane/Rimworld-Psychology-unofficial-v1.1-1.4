	<description>&lt;b&gt;Major update for 1.4!&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;GUI updates&lt;/b&gt;
The Psyche tab has been reworked for a better display of a pawn's personality. Antonyms and colors have been introduced for all personality nodes, a.k.a. personality traits. The new word cloud allows one to understand the relative strength of every trait at a glance. A concise summary of a pawn's personality in terms of the Big Five (or Five Factor Model) is also displayed by a radar graph. Sex and romance drives are now described for all pawns, not just asexual/aromantic ones.

&lt;b&gt;Ideology features&lt;/b&gt;
Personality will now interact with ideology. For example, a highly compassionate pawn will find the slavery precepts less appealing and a highly drug-friendly pawn will find the High Life meme more appealling. This compatibility affects the difficulty of converting pawns, and the daily certainty gain for established followers. Highly incompatible pawns can actually lose certainty over time. The player can remedy this with a new ability for the Moral Guide role called Indoctrinate. When used on other believers, it creates a shift in their personality that better favors their ideoligion. For example, indoctrination in a High Life ideoligion would make a pawn more drug-friendly, more experimental, and less pure. Several rounds of indoctrination will be needed for highly incompatible pawns, with gains diminishing as the pawn becomes more aligned with their ideoligion.

&lt;b&gt;Updated mod settings&lt;/b&gt;
Mod settings have been reworked and expanded. Several on/off settings have been converted into continuum values for more customized play. Dependency on HugsLib has been eliminated in favor of a more expansive settings window. The psychology and romance behavior now differs by individual species/race. For example, simple minded Tier-1 androids from the Android Tiers mod by default have psychology behaviors disabled, including dating. Elf-like/immortal species by default no longer have a romantic age gap factor applied to them once they reach adulthood. Sentient androids can now date at any age. All of this and more can be customized in the settings window.

&lt;b&gt;Compatibility with other mods&lt;/b&gt;
Psychology is now compatible with Character Editor and Prepare Carefully, but the player is &lt;b&gt;highly&lt;/b&gt; encouraged to choose Character Editor to avoid the various bugs and glitches of the latter. Former humans from Pawnmorpher will now keep their personalities has along as they remain sapient. Word of Love has been fixed for Vanilla Psycasters Expanded.

Optimizations have been made to reduce computational waste and (hopefully) improve performance. Various fixes and tweaks have been made to improve romance and conversation mechanics.

&lt;b&gt;The 1.4 update is a work in progress and maybe be unstable.&lt;/b&gt;
Please comment to report bugs and suggest additional features.

&lt;b&gt;Support&lt;/b&gt;
There is no form of financial support for this mod, but please subscribe, rate, and tell everyone about it. If you absolutely must spend money on something, then gift Rimworld to someone who hasn't yet experienced it to support Tynan and the incredible work that he does. This mod would not be possible without the great game he created, and the strenuous effort he has put into supporting mod creators.

	<!--&lt;b&gt;Compatibility&lt;/b&gt;
Thanks to HugsLib and Harmony, this mod should be compatible with practically everything. You can disable many features from the mod's options if you don't want to play with them, and also adjust your play experience. Mods which make changes to the code but do not use Harmony are quite likely to be incompatible with Psychology.-->
