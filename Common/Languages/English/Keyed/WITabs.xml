	<KinseyDescription>The Kinsey scale is used to describe a person's sexual orientation, and ranges from 0, meaning exclusively heterosexual, to a 6, meaning exclusively homosexual. Alfred Kinsey recognized that the seven categories of the scale could not fully capture every individual's sexuality. He wrote that "it should be recognized that the reality includes individuals of every intermediate type, lying in a continuum between the two extremes and between each and every category on the scale." He disliked the use of the term bisexual to describe individuals who engage in sexual activity with both men and women, preferring to use bisexual in its original, biological sense as hermaphroditic; he stated, "Until it is demonstrated [that] taste in a sexual relation is dependent upon the individual containing within his anatomy both male and female structures, or male and female physiological capacities, it is unfortunate to call such individuals bisexual."</KinseyDescription>
